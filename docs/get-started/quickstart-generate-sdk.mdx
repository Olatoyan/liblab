# Quickstart - Generate an SDK from your OpenAPI spec

This quickstart walks you through generating an SDK from your OpenAPI spec using liblab.

<div className="note-block">
  <p>NOTE</p>
Before working though this quickstart, make sure you have
registered an account with liblab, installed liblab CLI and logged in. Check out the <a href="getting-started">Getting Started guide</a> for more information.

</div>

To generate an SDK, follow these steps:

1. <a href="#create-a-liblab-configuration-file">
     Create a liblab configuration file
   </a>
2. <a href="#generate-your-sdk">Generate your SDK</a>
3. <a href="#review-and-test-your-sdk">Review and test your SDK</a>

## Create a liblab configuration file

The <a href="">`liblab.config.json`</a> file is used to configure how SDKs are generated. It includes information such as the name of the SDK, the programming language, the API spec file to use, how your API authenticates, and more. By using a configuration file you don't need to decorate your API spec with liblab specific annotations.

To create a configuration file, run the following command

<div className="code-block">
  <h3>Terminal</h3>

```bash
liblab init
```

</div>
This will create a file called <a href="">`liblab.config.json`</a> in your current
directory.

<div className="code-block">
  <h3>Terminal</h3>

```bash
âžœ  my-api: liblab init
liblab.config.json created successfully
Run liblab build to generate your SDKs
```

</div>

</details>

For your first spec, the important sections are:

- <a href="#sdkname">`sdkName`</a> - The name of your SDK. This will be used as the
  name of the SDK package.
- <a href="#specificfilepath">`specificFilePath`</a> - The path to your API spec.
  This can be a local path or a URL.
- <a href="#languages">`languages`</a> - The list of languages you want to generate
  SDKs for.
- <a href="#auth">`auth`</a> - What authentication your API uses.

### sdkName

Start by setting the <a href="">`sdkName`</a> to the name you want to use for your SDK. This will be used as the name of the SDK package. For example - if you set the `sdkName` to `exciting-soda` you will get a Python package called `excitingsoda`. This is the `pyproject.toml` file for the Python package:

<div className="code-block">
  <h3>pyproject.toml</h3>

```toml
[project]
name = "excitingsoda"
```

</div>

### specificFilePath

Next point the <a href="">`specificFilePath`</a> to your spec. This can be a local file, or a URL. For example, if you have a local spec file called `exciting-soda-openapi.yaml`, you could copy this to the same folder as the config file and set the value to this file:

<div className="code-block">
  <h3>liblab.config.json</h3>

```json
{
  "specFilePath": "./exciting-soda-openapi.yaml"
  ...
}
```

</div>

If this spec was online (for example a spec that is autogenerated by your API gateway), you could set the value to the URL:

<div className="code-block">
  <h3>liblab.config.json</h3>

```json
{
  "specFilePath": "https://exciting.soda/openapi.json"
  ...
}
```

</div>

### languages

The <a href="">`languages`</a> section is a list of languages you want to generate SDKs for. For example, if you want to generate SDKs for Python and TypeScript, you would set the value to:

<div className="code-block">
  <h3>liblab.config.json</h3>

```json
{
  "languages": [
    "python",
    "typescript"
  ]
  ...
}
```

</div>
You can find the full list of supported languages in the <a href="">language support guide</a>.

### auth

The <a href="">`auth`</a> section is used to specify the type of authentication your API uses. The `authentication` section of the `customizations` in the config file is also used to customize authentication. For example, if you are using bearer authentication, set this to `bearer`:

<div className="code-block">
  <h3>liblab.config.json</h3>

```json
{
  "auth": [
    "bearer"
  ]
  ...
}
```

</div>

You can read more on authentication in our <a href="">authentication guide</a>

## Generate your SDK

<div className="note-block">
  <p>NOTE</p>
Before generating your SDK, you should validate your spec. This will ensure that your spec is valid and that liblab can generate an SDK from it. The liblab CLI has a validator you can use to ensure that your config file is valid and that your spec is ready to be used to generate an SDK. For this quickstart, we won't be validating the spec, instead we will skip validation.

If you want to read more on validation, check out the <a href="">validation section of our CLI guide</a>.

</div>

Now that you have a liblab config file, you are ready to generate your SDK. To do this, run the following command:

<div className="code-block">
  <h3>Terminal</h3>

```bash
liblab build --skip-validation
```

</div>

This will generate your SDKs and docs. You will see a progress bar for each language, and a message when the SDKs and documentation are generated.

<div className="code-block">
  <h3>Terminal</h3>

```bash
âœ“ C# built
âœ“ Go built
âœ“ Java built
âœ“ Python built
âœ“ Terraform built
âœ“ TypeScript built

? Would you like to approve and publish these docs now? (Y/n)
```

</div>

The SDKs will be downloaded to a folder called output in your current directory. The SDKs will be available to preview online, or to download as a zip file using the links provided. You will also be asked of you want to approve the docs and publish them to the liblab docs site. You can learn more about this in our <a href="">SDK documentation guide</a>.

<p className="celebrate">
  ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations, you have generated your first SDK! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
</p>

## Review and test your SDK

The SDKs will be in the `output` folder, with one folder per language. Each folder is designed to be deployed to source code control, such as in GitHub, and contains standard git files such as a `.gitignore` appropriate for the language, as well as a `README.md` with SDK documentation.

```bash
output/
â”œâ”€ csharp
â”œâ”€ go
â”œâ”€ java
â”œâ”€ python
â”œâ”€ typescript
â””â”€ terraform
```

### Run an example

In each output folder there is an `example` folder containing a single, runnable example that calls the first API endpoint defined in the spec. This is designed to quickly show the SDK in use. In each `example` folder is an install script that installs the SDK and any dependencies, and a sample application you can run.

For example, in a Python SDK, you would run the following commands:

<div className="code-block">
  <h3>Terminal</h3>

```bash
cd output/python/examples
chmod +x ./install.sh
./install.sh

source ./.venv/bin/activate
python sample.py
```

</div>

This will make the `install.sh` file executable, then runs it. In the case of Python, this will create a virtual environment called `.venv` and will install the Python SDK into that environment. After this, you can activate the virtual environment and run the sample application.

Depending on the authentication you are using, you may need to set an environment variable containing an API key or bearer token. You can see the name of this environment variable in the sample application.

```bash
sdk.set_bearer_token(getenv("EXCITINGSODA_BEARER_TOKEN"))
```

### Use the SDK in a devcontainer

Each SDK can optionally have a development container configuration, allowing you to open these inside a development container in IDEs such as Visual Studio Code. To enable this, turn on the <a href="">`devContainer`</a> flag in your config file.

The container is configured with all the relevant dependencies, so once opened in a container you will be able to build the SDKs and run the examples without installing anything locally.

You can read more about development containers at <a href="">containers.dev</a>.

### Documentation

In addition to the documentation in the README, the deployed docs site contains full API and SDK documentation, including how to access the API using curl as well as using all the languages generated.
